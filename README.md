## 1.1 - Explain the Functions and Applications of Various Network Devices 

- Core connectivity devices
- Security devices
- Special purpose devices

### Hub
- Works at OSI Layer 1 (Physical)
- Hubs are multiport repeaters
  * Regenerate the signal  
- One big collision domain
- Good for network diagnostics and nothing else

### Switch
- Successor to the bridge
- Works at OSI Layer 2 (Data Link)
  * Can also function at OSI Layer 3 (Network)
- Switches store an in-memory MAC (aka media access control) table and provide dedicated bandwidth to each port (collision domain)

### Router
- Operates at OSI Layer 3 (Network)
- Seperate entire networks
- Modular design (especially Cisco)

### Wireless Acess Point
- Provides IEEE 802.11 connectivity
- Many support Power over Ethernet (PoE)
  * IEEE 802.af specifies 15.4W power
- Wireless LAN controllers
  * Centralized management of many WAPs
  
### Ethernet Domains
- Hub
  * One collision domain
- Switch
  * Four collision domains
- Router
  * Four broadcast and collision domains

### Configuring a Router
- VMWare or Virtualbox will allow for creation of computer and aoppliance instances in software
  * Vyos
  
    `$ show int`   
    `$ config`   
    `# set interfaces ethernet eth0 address 10.0.0.254/24`   
    `# save`   
    `# ping 10.0.0.254`   
    `# clear`
    
  * Ability to use tab completion with various CLI's
  * NOTE - Always ensure that you save configuration changes. A common beginner's mistake is making configurations and not saving the changes
  
### Security Devices
- Firewall
  * Exist as software or hardware varieties
  * Selectively allow or block network traffic
    - IP addresses, port numbers - packet-filtering firewall
  * Stateful packet inspection - Identifies sessions and can enforce rules on high level applications and services
  * Serves as a gatekeeper
- Intrusion Detection
  * Intrusion Detection System (IDS) - Passive detection of network traffics
    - Also called NIDS
  * Host-Based IDS (HIDS) - Protects local computer (Tripwire)
  * Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) - Active prevention of network attacks
  * Threat detection often involves signatures and anomolies
- Proxy/Cotent Filter
  * Forward proxy: Hides internal computers IP addresses from the internet
  * Reverse proxy: Publishes internal applications to the internet
  * Proxy provides security and sometimes content caching
  * Content filters use a subscription service (WebSense) to classify web content
  * Generally network devices often combine different but related functions as a all in one operation
- Remote Access and Performance Devices
  * Analog Modem
    - Modulate digital signals to anaolg for transmission over phone lines
    - Receiving modem demodulates analog to digital
    - Modems can have a purpose today
      * Special-purpose equipment that already uses a modem to send small amounts of data
      * "If it ain't broke, don't fix it"    
  * VPN Concentrator
    - Provides dedicated hardware circuitry to host virtual private network (VPN) connections
    - VPN protocols (tunneling and encryption) can be resource intensive
    - Server software can provide VPN services, with decreased cost but also decreased performance and scale
  * Load Balancer
    - Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple nodes
    - Load balancing gives users a faster experience
    - Load balancing is a way of providing high availability (HA)
  * Packet Shaper
    - Prioritize network traffic based upon your business rules
    - Ensures that certain types of traffic always have adequate bandwidth
    - Also ensures that low-priority traffic gets squashed to avoid DoS
    
### Load Balancing in Action Demonstration
  `C:\> ping -4 www.google.com`   
  `C:\> nslookup www.google.com`   
- We use nslookup to query Domain Name System (DNS) servers for informational or troubleshooting purposes
  
### Network Applicances with GUI Demonstration
- Web graphical interfaces (GUIs) are populare because you can get to them from almost anywhere, provided you have a web browser

### The Rack Unit
- Most enterprise servers come as rack mounted appliances
- Mount to rack by rails and "ears"
  * 1U standard is 1.75 inches or 44mm
  * Average rack is 42U or 19 inches wide (483mm)

- IPv6  address gives us 128 bits, almost unlimited amount
- RFC 1883 codified IPv6 in 1996, will be a long time before tranisitioning permanently

### Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Nat: one to one, one to many
- Dynamic NAT: Sharing multiple public IPs
- PAT - Port mapping or port forwarding
- DNAT: Also called port forwarding; used to publish private IPs to public internet
- SNAT: Source, static, stateful, secure

  * Network Infrastructure would be compatible with any type provided they follow the standards
  * Cable Types
    - Straight Through Cable - 568B on each side or 568A on each side
    - Crossover Cable - 568A and 568B on each side and not necessaryily used today as switches and routers incorporate the crossover
    - Rollover Cable - 568A and reversal of 568A ion other side

### Coaxial Copper Cables

### Plenum-grade Cable
  * Traditional cables coated with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) give off toxic fumes when burning
  * PVC vs. Plenum
    - The plenum is an enclosed space used for airflow
    - Usually thought of as the space above a drop ceiling or below a raised floor
    - Plenum grade cable should always be used in a plenum space
    - Plenum-grade cable has a fire-retardent plastic jacket consisting of low-smoke PVC

## 1.6 Differentiating Between Common Network Topologies

### Study Alerts for Exam
- Identify which network topology corresponds to a description
- Associate a nteowrk topology with Ethernet standards and Layer 1 devices

### Network Topologies
- Layout of a computer network can be physical or logical
  * Physical = how computers are actually arranged
  * Logical = how computers appear to be connected to the user
  
### Bus Topology
- All of the computers are connected in a straight line
- Referred to shared network conenctivity
- Terminators must be used  at each end of a bus segment to prevent signals from bouncing 
- A single break in the cable would take down the entire network

### Star Topology
- All of the computers are connected through a central connection point (hub)
- A single break in the cable would only take down communication to one computer
- A hub failure would take down the entire network

### Ring Topology
- All of the computers are connected in a circular fashion
- Token ring attempted to prevent the "collision domain" problems with 802.3 Ethernet
- Data is passed around the ring from computer to computer
- A break in the cable would take down the entire network
- Token Ring
  * IEEE 802.5
  * 4-16 Mbps
  * Physical star
  * Logical ring

### Mesh Topology
- All of the computers are connected to all other computers
- Typically used in a WAN environment
- Provides fault tolerance in the event of a connection failure
- Partial vs. Full

### Hybrid Topologies
-  Different types of topologies can be used together to form a hybrid topology

### Network Architectures
- More generally, we can consider a network architecture to be a plan, or blueprint, for a network design
- Point-to-Point
  * One node trnasmits data, and the other node receives it
  * Star, mesh, and logical ring are point-to-point
  * Telco uses point-to-point
    - For example, a voice telephone call
    - Leased line connection
- Point-to-Multipoint
  * Multiple communication paths from a single location to multiple locations
  * The Thinnet bus is point-to-multipoint
  * A hub-and-spoke Frame Relay cloud is point-to-multipoint
  * A WIFI hotspot is another example
  * IP telephony
  
### Client-Server
- Each host acts specifically as a server (resource provider) OR a client (resource receiver)

### Peer-to-Peer
- Every host acts as both a server AND a client

## 1.8 Implementing a Network Addressing Scheme

### Study Alerts for Exam
- General properties of IPv4 addresses
- General properties of IPv6 addresses
  * Recognize hexadecimal vs. decimal formats

### Physical Addresses
- MAC Addresses
  * Media Access Control (MAC) hardware addresses (OSI Layer 2)
  * 48 bit total
  * Each pair represents 8 bits
    - This makes sense mathematically as 4 bits give you 16 possible values (hexadecimal is base 16)
  * First 3 parts of the 48 bit MAC address is known as OUI (Organizational Unique Identifier)
  * Last 3 parts of a 48 bit MAC address is unique and assigned by the vendor
  * Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is the layer 2 protocol that resolves MACs from layer 3 IP addresses
  
### IPv4 Address Basics
- Defined in RFC 791
- Maintained by IANA
- The public address pool is exhausted
- 32-bits = 4.2 billion addresses
- IP addresses need subnet mask to be meaningful
- Default gateway is "near sode" router interface
- A host uses its subnet mask with other computers' IP addresses to check whether they are on the local network or if the connection requires a router

### IPv4 Address Structure
- Each octet can go from o to 255
- 256 combinations

### Classful Addressing
- Class A
  * First Octet: 1-126
  * Classful Mask: 255.0.0.0
  * CIDR Mask: /8
- Class B
  * First Octet: 128-191
  * Classful Mask: 255.255.0.0
  * CIDR Mask: /16
- Class C
  * First Octet: 192-223
  * Classful Mask: 255.255.255.0
  * CIDR Mask: /24
- Class D
  * First Octet: 224-255
- Loopback address: 127.0.0.1
- Classless addressing: Network break at any bit boundary
- 192.168.16.0/27 Example
  * 1 subnet with 30 hosts

### CIDR Notation
- Memorize at least to this point for questions in the exam
- CIDR is a large topic and needs to be looked at in more detail
- 192.168.4.0/24
  * 255.255.255.0
  * 1 subnet and 254 hosts
- Overview on Specific CIDR
  * 1000 0000 = /25 = 2 subnets, 126 hosts
  * 1100 0000 = /26 = 4 subnets, 62 hosts
  * 1110 0000 = /27 = 8 subnets, 30 hosts
  * 1111 0000 = /28 = 16 subnets, 14 hosts
  * 1111 1000 = /29 = 32 subnets, 6 hosts
  * 1111 1100 = /30 = 64 subnets, 2 hosts

### IPv4 Address Transmission Types
- Unicast
- Broadcast
- Multicast

### Revisiting Domains
- Collision
- Broadcast

### Private IP Addresses
- Classful Private IPs
- Class A
  * Range: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
  * Default Mask: 255.255.0.0
- Class B
  * Range: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
  * Default Mask: 255.255.0.0
- Class C
  * Range: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
  * Default Mask: 255.255.255.0
- RFCs 1918, 5737
- APIPA: 169.254.0.0/16 (technically Class B)

### Revisiting NAT and PAT
- NAT serves as a "shim" for IPv4
- Routers and admins maintain the NAT table
- PAT maps protocol ports
- We don't need NAT/PAT for IPv6

### IPv6
- IPv6 History and Basics
  * Finalized in RFC 1883 (1996)
  * 128 bit address space
  * 5*10 to the power of 28 IP addresses for every person on earth
  * Benefits
    - Simplified header structure
    - No broadcasts or packet fragmentation (unicast, multicast, and anycast)
    - Built-in IPSec
    - Co-existence with IPv4 (dual-stack, tunnels)
    
### IPv6 Address Format
- Uses hexadecimal (base 16) numbers for greater range
- 128 bits broken into 64 for network and 64 for node
  * 8 groups of 4 hex digits, with each group representing 16 bits (2 octets)
- Dropped leading zeros and compression
  * Format before - 2001:0db8:45b6:0:0:0:0:1
  * Format after - 2001:db8:45b6::1 
- Auto address generation
- DHCPv6
  * AAAA
- IPv6 Address Types
  * Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
    - Link-local addresses fs80::/64
    - EUI-64 derives IPv6 address by inserting a fixed value along with the 48-bit MAC address
- Loopback for IPv6 - ::1/128

### IPv6 Transition Protocols
- Dual stack: Run both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously
- 4in6: Encapsulate IPv4 traffic in IPv6 tunnels
- 6to4: Requires public IPv4 addresses
- Teredo: Can be used with NAT (written by a Microsoft employee)
- Miredo: *NIX implementation of Teredo

## 1.9 Understanding Routing Concepts and Protocols

### Study Alerts for Exam
- Identify
  * General characteristics of routing protocols
- Visualize
  * Packet flow to help you solve network problems

### Introduction to Routing
- What's a loopback address?
  * Tests IP data flows for the localhost (diagnostics)
  * IPv4: 127.0.0.1/8
  * IPv6 ::1/128

### Understanding Routing
- Packet transfers between IP subnetworks (broadcast domains)
- OSI Layer 3 IP addresses
- Route path options
  * Static routes: Okay for smallest of internetworks
  * Dynamic routes: Routers build a routing table by communicating with neighboring routers
- Default route: The router's "default gateway"

### Routing vs. Routed Protocols
- Routing protocols are used by routers to calculate best routes to remote networks
  * RIPv2, OSPF, BGP
- Routed protocols represent the data handles by routers
  * TCP/IP suite, with IPv4 and IPv6 in particular

### More Routing Vocabulary
- Convergence: The time it takes for all routers in an internetwork to possess a complete routing table
- Latency: Time it takes for a packet to cross router interfaces
- Administrative distance (AD): Arbitrary that judges precedence of a route (eg. Directly connected route = 1; bad route 100, etc.)
- Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU): The largest data unit that can be passed without dividing it into segments (fragmentation)
- Bandwidth: Link speed

### Routing Loops
- Occurs when a routing protocol algorithm error occurs
- Network traffic forms infinite loop
- Split horizon: Prevents a route learned on one interface from being advertised out same interface
- Poison Reverse: Marks Split Horizon routes with infinite metric

### Distance-Vector Routing Protocols
- Uses hop count as its routing metric
- Routing Information Protocol version 2 (RIPv2)

### Link-State Routing Protocols
- Router builds a map of the internetwork
  * Uses Link-state advertisements (LSAs)
- Metrics: cost values
- Protocol examples:
  * Open shortest Path First (OSFP); used in enterprise networks due to its performance and flexibility
- Intermediate System-to Intermediate System (IS-IS): Uses the Shortest Path Algorithim (SPF); used by ISPs

### Hybrid Routing Protocols
- Takes into account both hop count and cost metrics
- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): "The routing protocol of the internet
  * Called a Path Vector routing protocol
- Autonomous System (AS): Globally unique identifiers that connect large scale IP networks under the same routing policies

### Advanced Routing Concepts
- Interior and Exterior Gateway Protocols
  * Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs): Handle routing within an autonomous system (AS, routing domain)
    - This is where distance-vector and link-state routing protocols fit
  * Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGPs): Handle routing between ASs (think: service provider)
  
### Routing High Availability
- Shortest Path Bridging (SPF): IEEE 802.1aq; enables multipath routing
- Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) - IETF standard
- Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) - Cisco proprietary
- Virtual IP (VIP)

### Route Redistribution/Aggregation
- Aggregation: Also called route summarization; intende4d to minimize routing table size (bigger tables impact performance)
- Redistribution: A router injects a route learned with protocol A into protocol B; provides richer route redundancy (3Rs!)

### Virtualization
- Hardware virtualization
- Host: Running a hypervisor
  * Part of a CPU feature set
  * Microsoft Hyper-V
  * VMWare vSphere/EXSi
- Guest: The nested OS
  * "borrows" host hardware
- Lots of business benefits

### Virtual Networks
- Bridged: VM appears on same network as host
- NAT: VM "hides" behind host's IP address
- Host to Host: Internal private network
- Software-Defined Networking (SDN): Seperation of ocntrol plane from data plane

### Storage Area Networks (SANs)
- Network-Attached Storage (NAS): File-level access to storage using CIFS and NFS
  * the cost effective option
- Storage Area Network (SAN): Block-level access to storage
- You can easily virtualize iSCSI
- Some hypervisors even have virtual fibre Channel adapters

### Protocol Encapsulation
- Fibre Channel: High-speed (16Gbps) storage architecture
  * Expensive
- iSCSI: SCSI storage commands transmitted over full-duplex Ethernet
  * Cheap
- Jumbo frames: Ethernet frames are normally 1500 bytes (payload), but the Jumbo Frame spec allows MTUs of 9000 bytes

### Cloud Concepts
- What is cloud computing?
  * Service on demand/on tap
  * On-demand self-service
  * Resource pooling
  * Broad access
  * Rapid elasticity

### Cloud Service Models
- SaaS
  * Aimed at end users
  * Examples: Dropbox, Office 365
- PaaS
  * Aimed at developers
  * May overlap with SaaS and IaaS
  * Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- Iaas
  * Infrastructure as a Service
  * Aimed at IT pros
  * AWS, Azure, Google Cloud

### Cloud Delivery Models
- Public Cloud
  * All customers have same access
  * Dropbox
- Private Cloud
  * Business builds its own cloud infrastructure
  * Expensive
- Hybrid Cloud
  * Integrate public cloud services into private cloud
  * System Center and MS Azure

### Cloud Computing Practical Considerations
- Community cloud: Two or more organizations "pitch in" to create their own hybrid cloud (possible concerns of security)
- Remote access via SSH (TCP 22) or RDP (TCP 3389)
- Monitoring: built-in or third party network analyzer
  * Not to be confused with a protocol analyzer
  * Amazon Web Services (AWS) allows Nagios Network Analyzer
